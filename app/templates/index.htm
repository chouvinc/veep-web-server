            <p>
                Team members are the bread and butter of VEEP. We depend on
                <span class="emphasize">You</span> to make up our engineering teams! As a student you will be expected to
                contribute towards a project for either 1 or 2 semesters, keeping track of progress and communicating with your
                Not-for-Profit clients and Project Managers along the way.
            </p>

            <p>Your timeline will look a little something like this (double the time length for Weeks 3~10 for year-long projects) :</p>

            <ul class="expanded">
                <li>
                    Week 1: Meet with your team, Project Manager, and Not-for-Profit. Develop preliminary
                    project requirements and discuss between your team which features build into the Minimal Viable
                    Product (MVP) that your client can accept.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Week 2~3: Revise, plan, and begin executing your project requirements. Your Project Manager
                    will outline what we call a <span class="emphasize">Rolling Schedule</span>, and how they
                    plan to keep development fast-paced and continuous throughout the school year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Week 4~7: Implement the MVP that you defined in the earlier weeks! We don't expect you to
                    completely finish all aspects of the project! Many of our projects are quite large in scope and
                    often have additional features to work towards. We understand that there are other commitments
                    during the school year which can impact your availability to work on your VEEP project. However,
                    it is expected that you stay <span class="emphasize">Accountable</span> and plan ahead. VEEP will
                    treat lack of communication as a sign that you no longer wish to participate and you will no longer
                    be able to work on your project or sign-up for other VEEP opportunities in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Week 8~9: Clean-up and polish your MVP. Did you do a poor job documenting the process to
                    meet deadlines? Use this 2-week period to fix any minor issues that were in the prototype's
                    design. If you wouldn't buy your own project as a product or service then it is not polished enough!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Week 10~12: Work towards those additional features! Congratulations! At this point you already have
                    a fully-functional and robust product. If you wanted to end here you technically could, but we
                    really encourage students to further extend their projects to meet the stretch goals designed for
                    these features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Week 13~14: Assemble your documentation and prepare for the <span class="emphasize"><a href="{{url_for('.events')}}">
                    Year End Project Showcase</a></span>. This is your chance to show Not-for-Profits that you are good
                    enough for professional work! The Year End Project Showcase is a new initiative we began to show
                    off VEEP's technical rigour and creativity. Even if your project isn't finished at this point,
                    we'd still like you to present your engineering processes and your approaches to solving problems!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="project_manager" class="contentBody" hidden>
            <p>
                Project Managers are for students looking to improve their leadership and long-term analysis abilities.
                We would like to invite anyone with previous <span class="emphasize">Industry or Research</span> experience
                to come and volunteer at VEEP. Each Project Manager is assigned 1~2 teams and should have domain knowledge
                directly related to the field of the project they're managing.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past students have been given the responsibility of making overall design decisions, but for a
                learning experience this can often lead to unstable or unmaintainable projects. As a Project Manager
                with previous work experience, you support your team with high-level architectural outlines that give the teams
                direction and reassurance. You will personally review each and every feature implemented by the students;
                whether that be through code review, simulations, or end-to-end testing. Discussion between you and individual
                team members is highly encouraged, as we hope to foster the next wave of project managers from our
                VEEP teams!
            </p>

        <div id="executive" class="contentBody" hidden>
            <p>
                VEEP Executives are the drivers behind program changes and new initiatives. They are typically students
                who themselves have been through VEEP and want to make a lasting <span class="emphasize">impact</span>
                on the organization. As the organization matures we will be recruiting for more and more executives
                across all teams. For now, take a look at the different teams we have and think about how you would
                like to contribute towards VEEP:
            </p>

            <ul class="expanded">
                <li>
                    Marketing - The marketing team has traditionally only consisted of one person, but we're hoping
                    to change that to increase our campus presence. Executives on the marketing team look after
                    major events that occur throughout the year, such as the Club Fair, and produce advertising
                    materials to be used for the events. They also oversee our social media and keep both the
                    Not-for-Profits and students aware of the latest VEEP news.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Business Development - Business Development, or BD, reaches out to the community for lasting
                    relations between VEEP and the outside world. All of the projects shown on this website have
                    been formed through BD. In addition to projects, the BD team looks for external resources that
                    VEEP can offer to our students. Things like workshops, online courses, and access to coaching
                    are all driven by BD.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operations - Executives in Operations (or Ops) are responsible for making sure VEEP runs smoothly.
                    They gather and analyze information to understand any inefficiencies that are present in the
                    organization and prioritize, plan, and execute solutions to fix them. While BD executives find new
                    initiatives, Ops handle how they are actually implemented in the context of the organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Digital Team - Like marketing, VEEP has only ever had one person at a time working on the Digital
                    Team. As our organization grows, this team's role has proven to increase in importance. Things like
                    metrics are all much more convenient to gather using software rather than manual methods. In addition,
                    updates to the website and other software platforms become much more difficult and time consuming
                    with only a single person in the role. We are looking for dedicated, upcoming software developers
                    to improve both our website and other internal tooling. Previous experience is preferred,
                    but we don't mind mentoring as long as applicants demonstrate enthusiasm.
                </li>

            <p>
                Welcome to our website! Not-for-Profits are the core of our operation and without them, VEEP would
                cease to exist! As an NFP, you can expect to communicate first with our BD representatives, and then
                extensively with our student teams and PM's. Special circumstances such as long-lasting partnerships
                spanning multiple projects may also have you in consistent contact with Ops. As a Not-for-Profit, you
                are exposed to all aspects of the VEEP life cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please don't hesitate to reach out by <a href="{{ url_for('.contact_us') }}">Contacting Us</a>. If
                this is the first time you've heard about VEEP, we can connect you to one of our BD executives to draft
                up requirements and schedule you for the next iteration of VEEP projects!
