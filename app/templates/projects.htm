            VEEP partners with the local community to promote engineering growth and leadership! Our projects are designed
            to be technically challenging, requiring a commitment of 7-10 hours per week. If you are a student please click
            on one of the projects below to apply; if you are a not-for-profit please click on the "Contact Us" tab or
            click the link here: <a href="{{url_for('.contact_us')}}">Contact Us</a>

        <p class="contentBody">
            This year <i>all projects</i> will have a mandatory <a href="{{url_for('.events')}}">
            Year End Project Showcase</a>. It is our strong belief that students should be rewarded for their hard work,
            and we have a few events in the pipeline to make the extra effort of creating a presentation for all to
            see worthwhile. Please keep track of the <a href="{{url_for('.events')}}">Events</a> page for more updates.

        <h4>VEEP Projects</h4>
        <p class="contentBody">
            These are the traditional VEEP projects, which require students to be able to take initiative and perform
            difficult architectural decisions. There will be some guidance through our Technical Project Managers, but
            ultimately design decisions lie with the student team. Students that apply for traditional VEEP projects
            typically have extensive experience in the project's field, or have shown lightning fast learning speeds
            through prior endeavours.

        <h4>VEEP-X Projects</h4>
        <p class="contentBody">
            VEEP-X is a program that we started in the fall semester of 2017. Realizing that there was a gap for students
            just starting their engineering career, we produced a program with projects that are a little less technically
            demanding and a little more well defined. Students applying for these projects have little to no experience
            in engineering projects -- these projects are their first performance in a professional environment.

            If you have no engineering experience, no worries! We are looking to develop the next generation of engineering
            students, so these projects will be heavily focused on learning opportunities, rather than project outcomes.
